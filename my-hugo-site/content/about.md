  Hi! I'm Sri. ðŸ‘‹ 
    
  I don't really know how to best introduce myself, so here are some facts about me in no particular order: 
  
  I was born in Mumbai, moved to the US about 10 years ago and have been living in the New England region since. 
  
  I love traveling to new places and experiencing different cultures. I try to squeeze in a few trips every year whenever I can.
  In my free time, I like playing video games and watching TV shows.
  
   I am currently working as a Software Engineer in the healthcare tech industry, there's always something new to learn.
  
  To stay healthy and clear my mind, I like to go on long walks and ride my road bike.
 
 I also like to learn new languages. Feel free to add me on [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com/profile/siyerr) if you want to be language buddies.
